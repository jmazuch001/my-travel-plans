# Travel Destinations

A simple app to keep track of destinations I'd like to visit. 
This app was part of Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree Program and linked to the "course-collaboration-travel-plans" repository. 
The goal was to use Git as VCS to push and commit files and changes to a repository (the one you are viewing now) and going off of 
the aforementioned repo as a baseline as per program instructions.
The goal was also to practice and test competency in using version control software, including functions such as branching, forced
terminations, pull vs fetch, reviewing a repo's history, undoing changes, tagging, merging, and merge conflicts.
